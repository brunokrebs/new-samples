# Aurelia 00-Basic

This application is Aurelia version of the standard 00-Basic application - a skeleton without any Auth0 specific code. While the "look and feel" of this application conforms to the general style of all other Auth0 [quick-starts](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstarts), the code is written using the best practices for writing Aurelia applications. This approach will help Aurelia developers "feel at home" when visiting Auth0 site to learn how to add the support for Auth0 Identity Management services.
