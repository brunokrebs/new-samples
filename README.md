Re-implementation if the https://github.com/auth0-community/auth0-aurelia-samples collection, designed to fit the Auth0 samples set pattern as well as to look familiar to Aurelia users.

This sample set is built with Aurelia CLI tooling, selecting the default module loader - webpack 4.1. The **[basic]** aplication is derived from the from the matching element of Aurelia [skeleton-navigation](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation) collection:

- **[esnext-basic](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation/tree/master/skeleton-esnext-webpack)** in the case of **[ES6](https://github.com/aurelia-auth0/new-samples/tree/master/esnext-webpack)** samples set
- **[typescript-basic](https://github.com/aurelia-auth0/new-samples/tree/master/typescript-webpack)** in the case of Typescript samples set
